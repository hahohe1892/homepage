In a 3-day workshop organized by the CodeRefinery I learned a lot of things, among others how to create websites using GitHub. Of course, I wanted to test this new skill immediately. So even though this website doesn't have an actual purpose (I don't expect high traffic), I see it as a fun side project to play with. And who knows, maybe one day I actually feel the need of having a home page. In that case, I'd already know what to do..
